# Project Documentation

This project is a fullstack application that combines a Vue.js frontend with a FastAPI backend. 

## Project Structure

The project is organized into two main directories: `frontend` and `backend`.

### Frontend

The frontend is built using Vue.js and is structured as follows:

- `src/`: Contains the source code for the Vue.js application.
  - `App.vue`: The root component of the Vue.js application.
  - `main.ts`: The entry point for the Vue.js application.
  - `components/`: Contains reusable Vue components.
    - `HelloWorld.vue`: A simple greeting component.
  - `views/`: Contains the different views of the application.
    - `Home.vue`: The home view of the application.
  - `router/`: Contains the routing configuration.
    - `index.ts`: Sets up the Vue Router for the application.
- `package.json`: Configuration file for npm, listing dependencies and scripts.
- `vite.config.ts`: Configuration file for Vite, the build tool used for the Vue.js application.

### Backend

The backend is built using FastAPI and is structured as follows:

- `app/`: Contains the source code for the FastAPI application.
  - `main.py`: The entry point for the FastAPI application.
  - `api/`: Contains the API endpoints.
    - `endpoints.py`: Defines the API endpoints and route handlers.
  - `models/`: Contains the data models.
    - `models.py`: Defines the structure of the data.
  - `schemas/`: Contains the Pydantic schemas for data validation.
    - `schemas.py`: Defines the schemas used for validation and serialization.
- `requirements.txt`: Lists the dependencies required for the backend project.
- `config.py`: Contains configuration settings for the FastAPI application.
